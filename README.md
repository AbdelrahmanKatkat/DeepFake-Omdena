## Project Overview

This project is aimed at developing a machine learning solution to detect deepfake images by creating a model capable of distinguishing between authentic and deepfake content. Deepfake technology has advanced rapidly, and it's crucial to develop robust methods to identify manipulated media.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is recent, collected from a challenge held in 2022. It contains real images from publicly available datasets such as CelebA and FFHQ. Additionally, it includes fake images generated by various deepfake techniques like StarGAN, GDWCT, AttGAN, StyleGAN, and StyleGAN2. The dataset suffers from class imbalance, which is addressed during data augmentation.

## Data Augmentation

Data augmentation is a crucial step in this project. We use the Albumentations library to perform various augmentations on both real and deepfake images. Key augmentation techniques include:

- Resizing images to a consistent size (e.g., 160x160 pixels)
- Random rotation (0 to 360 degrees)
- Horizontal or vertical flip
- Shear and zoom transformations
- Shifting the height or width
- Blacking out regions such as eyes, face, or mouth
- Image compression
- Gaussian blurring or adding Gaussian noise
- Adjusting brightness, saturation, hue, and contrast

It's essential to strike a balance between augmentation techniques to avoid over-degrading the dataset.

## Model

Three different models were considered for deepfake detection:

1. **VGG16**:
   - Pretrained with ImageNet weights
   - Custom layers added: Average Pooling, Dropout, and Output sigmoid

2. **EfficientNet B5**:
   - Pretrained model chosen for its efficiency
   - Further fine-tuned for deepfake detection

3. **EfficientNet B7**:
   - A more powerful version of EfficientNet
   - Customized for this task

## Model Parameters

- **N_EPOCHS**: 3 (Number of epochs for training)
- **VERBOSE**: 1 (Verbosity level during training)
- **N_REPLICAS**: 2 (Number of model replicas)
- **LR_MAX**: 5e-6 * N_REPLICAS (Learning rate)
- **WD_RATIO**: 1e-5 (Weight Decay ratio)
- **N_WARMUP_EPOCHS**: 0 (Number of warm-up epochs)

These parameters are essential for training and fine-tuning the models.

**Conclusion** ðŸŽ‰

In this deepfake detection project, three powerful models were evaluated: VGG16, EfficientNet B5, and EfficientNet B7. The goal was to develop a model that could effectively distinguish between authentic and deepfake images.

The models were put to the test, and their performance was assessed using essential metrics. VGG16 displayed an accuracy of 77%, EfficientNet B5 achieved 76%, and EfficientNet B7 scored 73%. These results indicate that VGG16 performed the best among the three models.

While all models showed potential, the choice of model ultimately depends on the specific requirements and trade-offs of the application. VGG16, with its higher accuracy, is a favorable option when maximizing precision in deepfake detection is critical. EfficientNet B5 is a balanced choice, offering competitive performance, while EfficientNet B7, although slightly behind in accuracy, may still serve well in scenarios where computational resources are a limiting factor.

This project underscores the significance of using state-of-the-art models and augmentation techniques to combat the challenges posed by deepfake content, making strides in maintaining the integrity of digital media.
